# On-Demand Car Wash Service App – Bhopal

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to provide **on-demand and subscription-based car washing services** for customers in **Bhopal**, India.

The platform connects **car owners** with **verified local car washers**, enabling convenient booking, scheduling, and service management through a digital interface. The goal is to replace informal, unreliable car wash arrangements with a **structured, predictable, and scalable service model**, especially suited for residential areas like Kolar Road and nearby localities.

## Problem Statement

Car owners in Bhopal face recurring issues:

* Inconsistent availability of local car washers
* No fixed schedules or accountability
* Manual cash payments with no service history
* Difficulty managing daily or weekly wash routines

Car washers, on the other hand:

* Depend on word-of-mouth and physical presence
* Lack predictable income
* Have no tools to manage routes, customers, or payments

This project solves both sides of the problem.
